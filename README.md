## UX (briefly explain your design)
The forum's design is minimalistic yet colorful to let the topics and posts speak for the website. Cosmos wants the user to feel like they are in an old record store with a modern twist.

### Colour Scheme (explain your colors, etc.... perhaps use coolors.co?)
The website's primary colors are Black, light grey, and white.
The website's accent colors are (coming soon).

### Typography (explain any fonts and icon libraries used, font-awesome/google fonts, etc)
* Headings/Menu/Footer/Comments: Montserrat subrayada
* paragraph text: Quicksand
* Logo: Modak

The fonts for this project are minimalistic but still familiar to the user. The font Montserrat subrayada is used for the significant headings to create a clean and minimalistic feel to the website.
The font Quicksand creates a soft, warm, and familiar feeling for the paragraph text.
